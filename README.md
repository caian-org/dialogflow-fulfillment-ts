This repository contains a hard-fork of [`dialogflow-fulfillment-nodejs`][dfn]
plus [this gist][gist] that I've found lurking [this issue][issue].

Since Google didn't respond it and haven't made any changes and/or improvements
to the project for more than an year, I've published this as a npm package so I
can work with types on muh bots.


## Install
